## üöÄ Featured Projects

### üéì [Master‚Äôs Thesis ‚Äì Deep Learning Solutions for Autonomous Vehicles](https://github.com/atomic01/ICRL-Agent)
Explores **intermittent control theory** within **reinforcement learning** for autonomous driving.  
Implements DQN-based agents in the **CARLA simulator**, investigating how intermittent updates influence learning efficiency and stability.

### üß© [Bachelor‚Äôs Thesis ‚Äì A* Pathfinding Maze Solver](https://github.com/atomic01/AStar-MazeSolver)
A C-based visualization tool for solving large maze environments using the **A*** pathfinding algorithm.  
Focuses on heuristic graph traversal, optimal route computation, and visualization of search-space exploration.

### üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è [Gym Website ‚Äì 17.Fitness](https://github.com/atomic01/17fitness)
A **WordPress-based informational site** for a local gym, designed with **Blocksy** and **Elementor**.  
Includes multilingual support, class scheduling, and a modern responsive layout for desktop and mobile visitors.

## üí° About Me
Over time, I've come to believe that good engineering is less about writing code and more about designing clarity.  
I approach every project as a conversation with the next developer ‚Äî even if that developer is future me.  

### üß≠ I Believe
- Clean code is a form of communication, not decoration.  
- Architecture should reduce future pain, not add current complexity.  
- Automation is how engineers show respect for their own time.  
- Readability is the first optimization.  
- The best systems are boring in production and elegant in design.  
- Every refactor is a chance to refine thought, not just fix mistakes.  
- Learning is continuous ‚Äî each failure teaches as much as each success.
