### 🚀 Projects
- **[Master’s Thesis – Deep Learning Solutions for Autonomous Vehicles](https://github.com/atomic01/MSc-Project-Appendices)**  
A research project exploring reinforcement learning for autonomous vehicle control within the CARLA simulator. The study investigates how intermittent control theory influences learning efficiency and stability in deep neural network–based driving agents.

- **[Bachelor’s Thesis – A* Pathfinding Maze Solver](https://github.com/atomic01/SolvingTheMazeProblemWithAStarAlgorithm)**  
A program that visualizes and solves randomly generated mazes using the A* pathfinding algorithm. The system demonstrates heuristic-based graph traversal and optimal route computation, producing a visual output that highlights the shortest path through the maze.

- **[Gym Website – 17.fitness](https://17.fitness)**  
  A WordPress-based informational website for a local gym with a responsive layout and simple content management.
