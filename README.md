# üëã Hi, I'm Ante Tomicic

**Software Engineer** with 3+ years of experience in backend and automation development ‚Äî specializing in **C++**, **Python**, and **CI/CD systems**.  
I‚Äôve worked on large-scale enterprise software, building backend components, automation frameworks, and developer tools.  
My focus is on **clarity, maintainability, and automation** ‚Äî because clean systems scale better, and so do teams.

## üí° I Believe  
- Clean code is communication, not decoration.  
- Architecture should simplify, not glorify complexity.  
- Automation is how engineers respect their own time.  
- Readability beats premature optimization.  
- The best systems are boring in production.  
- Every refactor refines thought, not just code.  
- Growth never ends ‚Äî every project teaches something new.
